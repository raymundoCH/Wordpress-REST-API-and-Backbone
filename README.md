# Wordpress REST API and BackboneJS

This project implements the BackboneJS library to exchange data with the REST API. The CRUD operations are implemented to create, read, update and delte
a post into the local Wordpress site.

## Requirements

- Local Wordpress installation
- Some local web server. In my case the PHP web dev server was implemented.

## Instructions

Once you have cloned the repository navigate to the root folder of the project with the console and run the next command:

~~~
php -S localhost:8000
~~~
